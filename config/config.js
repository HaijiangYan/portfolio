  description: [
    "I received my BSc degrees in Medical Technology and Psychology from Peking University in 2019, where I started to be interested in information processing in human brain (the most complex and fascinating machine created by nature), particularly on algorithmic level from a systematic perspective. After that, I began to study how human behavior and neural system are interacted with gaming addiction at Chinese Academy of Sciences, and received MSc there in 2022. Currently, I'm pursuing a PhD in Psychology at the University of Warwick, focusing on human behavior, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. My research explores the intersection of human cognition and AI, aiming to better understand and model how people process information, generate interpretations to the world and make decisions. On the other hand, how current AI can benefit from insights into human cognition. Outside of my main projects, I'm passionate about developing web applications that make a positive impact to scientific community. I value creativity, continuous learning, and using technology to solve real-world problems. My motto is 'Passion is all you need'.",
